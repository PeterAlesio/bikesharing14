## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze data from Citibike in NYC by looking at both geographical data and the demographic data of the user to determine if it is a worthy investment for Des Moines.

## Summary
### findings
  1. Male users are more prevelant than female users. especially during the night.
  2. subscribers are the main users of Citibike
  3. the peak hours are between 6 am-10am and 4pm-8pm
 
 One additional visualization I would perform would be to compare the staring area to the gender of the user to determine if there is a preference between the genders on where they would feel comfortable using a bike to get around.
 
 A second visualization I would perform would be to compare starting location by user type to hopefully find a hub of 1 time customers so we can determine where we can focus marketing efforts to turn them into subscribers.
